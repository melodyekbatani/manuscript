## Context
This was my first coding project for Type and Interaction using HTML and CSS! The project was based on the reading Typography is a Grid by Anthony Froshaugh, which can be found here: https://readings.design/PDF/TypographyisaGrid.pdf

What started as an exploration of type relative to a lined grid quickly evolved into creating a system of rules to guide design decisions. The goal of this project was to apply basic skills in typography and code to typeset the reading and my response. I used various elements within the HTML and CSS to give both semantic and visual definition.

## Systems
I began adding meaning to the semantic structure, breaking down each section of the reading and response as distinct pieces. From there, I applied base paragraph font sizes and adjusted them by scaling the root size. To create hierarchy, I emphasized headings and quotes, and transformed the figures to match the format of those in the original reading.

The reading itself was about forming a system of rules for typography, and I treated the grid in the same way. In both my analysis and site design, I wanted to develop a system around font sizes, styles, spacing, and color. Color was especially challenging, and I decided to limit the palette to three key colors: black, white, and blue, and align my design to those parameters. I felt this reflected my interpretation of the reading and tied the two sections of the site together.

## Experiments
Throughout this exercise, I also experimented with historical font styles such as blackletter and drop caps. The most fun and surprising part was creating the dreaded “wobble” effect in Figure One. I discovered the multi-cursor select tool in Visual Studio Code, which changed the game and let me wrap spans around each letter and moving them up and down.

I treated the navigation as an anchor and each title as its own section within the design. I also added a bookend with the footer navigation, matching the style of the header. While rules guided most decisions, I also allowed intentional exceptions, for example, giving special emphasis to blockquote 1, which I considered especially important. 

## Results
My process throughout this design related so strongly to the reading itself, showing me that typography is a framework for expression, and setting up rules can lead to interesting outcomes!
