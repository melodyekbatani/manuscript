                    'Typography is a grid'. Published 1967, in: The Designer [bibl. 122]. 
                     The article was written at the height of the vogue for grid-based graphic design, 
                     imported into Britain from (especially) Switzerland. In an earlier contribution to 
                     The Designer, Brian Grimbly-a friend and colleague of AF -had discussed grids in a 
                     purely pragmatic way, as a tool for designers. ('Designing to a grid', The Designer, 
                     no. 162, August 1966, pp. 4-5). AF then wrote this 'call to order', restating central 
                     tenets of his approach to typography. Some slight editorial changes have been made in 
                     reprinting the article here. Notes to the text and illustrations were originally numbered 
                     in one sequence, but have here been renumbered in two sequences. As explained in the editorial 
                     note on p. 189 below, the cover image ofthat issue of The Designer constituted one of the 
                     illustrations. It has been omitted here: reproduced small it would have little meaning, and 
                     similar images can be seen in the reproductions from Typographic norms on pp. 71-4 above. 'Typography
                     is a grid' was reprinted in Design Dialogue, no.1, 1969: a magazine edited by students at Stafford 
                     College of Art and Design. A F's work was important for the design course at Stafford, as Peter 
                     Burnhill implied in his retrospective: 'Outside the whale', Information Design Journal, vol.8, no. 
                     3, 1996, pp. 195-218.

        <em>
            Grid structures are implicit in the word typography. After half a millennium it is time for 
            an understanding and re-assessment
        </em>
    </p>

    <p> 
        To mention both typographic, and, in the same breath/sentence, grids, is strictly tautologous. The 
        word typography means to write/print using standard elements; to use standard elements implies some 
        modular relationship between such elements; since such relationship is two-dimensional, it implies 
        the determination of dimensions which are both horizontal and vertical. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Consider the problems which faced Gutenberg, some five hundred years ago, in helping 'the eternal God'
        to bring 'into existence the laudable art, by which men now print books, and multiply them so greatly....
        <sup>1</sup> Item, the said Johann Gutenberg knew of the invention of paper (which had reached Cologne 
        by 1320); item, knew of the development of suitable inks ... of the general features of the cloth- 
        and winepress, of the arts of the engravers, of the die- and punch-making of the goldsmiths (after all, 
        he was a goldsmith himself).<sup>2</sup> What did Gutenberg invent?
    </p>

    <p>
        In order that letters, characters, may be arranged in lines, line upon line, for printing, each letter 
        must be of the same depth or body-size as its neighbours, irrespective of its individual width: the 
        vertical dimension (y in Cartesian co-ordinates) is critical. If, as seems historically probable, Gutenberg's 
        invention was that of the adjustable type-mould, tolerant of characters of differing widths, intolerant of 
        divergence in body-size [1: overleaf], this invention acted as a vertical grid upon the setting, the form, the page.

       as more lately in the case of 13-pica fixed newspaper sticks, an unadjustable hod into which the standard

     <p>
       Of course, the fixing of a horizontal dimension or 'measure' demands conventions of variable spacing between words,
       * or of abbreviation of the words themselves [2], if all the characters align at left, where the line begins, 'and 
       are to end as leadsoldiers dressed by the right. The multifarious grids used by the scribes were directly translated 
       into the techniques of metal setting. The scribes had long explored the two-dimensional axes, long before Gutenberg, 
       long before Descartes described them as constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
       This account restricts itself to those who used the Latin alphabet, who read from left to right; but only so far as 
       concerns continuous narrative text. Quite early on, even in the days of incunabula, not only letters but other characters, 
       for example numerals, needed setting - and in the attempt of mathematical conventions to show the sequence of a proof, 
       equalities and tabulations were aligned, each below its antecedent step: centring a new implicit axis on the page [3].
    </p>
        
    <p>
        So during centuries: for the first ninety years of typographic printing saw the exploration and development of justified 
        and unjustified setting, of italic, of new letters (J and U surviving; some, like the omega, left at last), of punctuation marks. 
        After 1530, though, interest shifted toward experiment in letter design and, later, mechanical improvement.
    </p>

    <p> 
        All later work, until the demands of writers such as Blake or Mallarmé disrupted the conventions, considered the typographic 
        grid unalterable [4]. And even with the poets, their understanding of typography was such that they hardly considered the
        presentation of their personal desires a challenge to the grid.
    </p>

    <p>
        And here's a sadness.Typography, as taught in schools of art, and captioned in the illustrated books, is mostly but a word delimiting a 
        field of art-/craft-history; books of types, of typographic ornaments and rules, of title-pages (fewer books of double-page spreads), 
        sit on their shelves or presses. Typography (sic) has become the study of placing letters onafield: typography, a more precise form oflettering.
        And lettering, calligraphy, has died some sweet Roman death or letraset itself below the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is time, after half a millennium,for the re-assessment of typography. In architecture, stones, mud, plants humbled together, were governed; labour
        was delegated, craftsmen worked their feeling for materials on that material, builders organized, architects, later, chiefed constructions. After the 
        decline of architecture, all major work nowadays is done by those who dreamed of white cathedrals or had an intimate experience or interest in their material, 
        old or new.

            Published in 1960s Britain, Froshaugh's Typography is a Grid addresses a system of organization that became the dominant system for organizing typography. 
            It was heavily accepted as the only way type can be laid out and can be clearly identified in the way in which Froshaugh's own text is arranged.
            To better understand this text, I researched the historical and cultural context in which Froshaugh lived. At this time, a new generation of modernist designers 
            was emerging and gaining influence in London's design scene, not to mention the tremendous growth of London's steel industry. This changing environment also led 
            to a change in how space and subsequently type were perceived. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Thus, the grid became more than a tool; it symbolized order and modernity. Printing, at that time, 
            was also designed as an arrangement of individual characters fixed within a metal framework, which meant that a grid was both a product of the tool and a result of it. 
            The adoption of printing led to a widespread acceptance of the grid as the way type should be arranged.Though the relationship between typography and the grid is not 
            fixed, they are closely connected. Where type creates expression, the grid brings order, much like language, which utilizes grammar as a structural tool but allows 
            unlimited ways to express ideas. Its visual form, typography, relies on grids as a system of structure to communicate with clarity, providing a set of restrictions for 
            creativity to play into. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Froshaugh also connects the relationship between typography and grid to cartography. In Cartography, the grid acts as a way to orient the viewer. 
            The grid provides guidance for the reader and suggests a sense of order. 
            Although it is interesting to note that these elements shouldn't be seen as completely neutral, they indirectly express values, politics, cultural norms, and power. Froshaugh shares 
            the example of reading from left-to-right reading - a primary western way to read. Today, this applies to how we design interfaces, documents, and websites.
        </p>

        <p>
            This reading continues its relevance in digital design, where websites and user interfaces depend on grids and templates. Just as early typographers used grids for printed text, 
            today's designers use them to arrange content on screens. The grid has become a standard, quietly shaping how we interact with information. Continuing to speak to the singular 
            identity of the web today, it has become heavily simplified in its conceptual approach. There is a learnt way that we all browse the web, in the same manner that we read from 
            left to right in the Western world.
        </p>

        <p>
            As someone who heavily uses grids to design, this had me questioning what we lose by relying on them. Grids allow information to become accessible, but they can also reduce creativity 
            and limit the variety of design concepts someone can create. Froshaug's persuasion to rethink typography, even after hundreds of years, highlights this tension.
            Therefore, the grid in typography is not a rigid rule but a conceptual one, a system that supports clarity while also inviting reinterpretation. 
            As designers, it is our role to use these systems knowingly, understanding when to follow and break the rules we set for ourselves. 
            Typography doesn't need a grid to exist, but the grid continues to shape how we see, understand, and communicate.
