							<cite>Typography is a grid</cite> published <time datetime="1967"> 1967</time>, in: <cite>The Designer</cite> [bibl. 122]. The article was written at the height of the vogue for grid-based graphic design, imported into Britain from (especially) Switzerland. In an earlier contribution to <cite>The Designer</cite>, Brian Grimbly-a friend and colleague of AF -had discussed grids in a purely pragmatic way, as a tool for designers. <cite>'Designing to a grid', The Designer, no. 162,</cite> <time datetime="1966-08"> August 1966</time>, pp. 4-5. AF then wrote this <q>call to order</q>, restating central tenets of his approach to typography. Some slight editorial changes have been made in reprinting the article here. Notes to the text and illustrations were originally numbered in one sequence, but have here been renumbered in two sequences. 
						</p>
						<p>
							As explained in the editorial note on p. 189 below, the cover image of that issue of <cite>The Designer</cite> constituted one of the illustrations. It has been omitted here: reproduced small it would have little meaning, and similar images can be seen in the reproductions from Typographic norms on pp. 71-4 above.<cite> Typography is a grid</cite> was reprinted in <cite>Design Dialogue, no.1</cite>,<time datetime="1969"> 1969 </time>: a magazine edited by students at Stafford College of Art and Design. A F's work was important for the design course at Stafford, as Peter Burnhill implied in his retrospective: <cite>Outside the whale</cite>, <cite>Information Design Journal</cite>, vol.8, no. 3, <time datetime="1966">1996</time>, pp. 195-218.

					<p> 
						To mention both typographic, and, in the same breath/sentence, grids, is strictly tautologous. The word typography means to write/print using standard elements; to use standard elements implies some modular relationship between such elements; since such relationship is two-dimensional, it implies the determination of dimensions which are both horizontal and vertical. 
					</p>
					<!-- not entierely sure about superscript and if its the right tag to the footnote references here - check with Micheal and Rijk -->
					<p>
						Consider the problems which faced Gutenberg, some five hundred years ago, in helping <q>the eternal God to bring</q> into existence the laudable art, by which men now print books, and multiply them so greatly <sup>1</sup> Item, the said Johann Gutenberg knew of the invention of paper (which had reached Cologne by 1320); item, knew of the development of suitable inks of the general features of the cloth-and winepress, of the arts of the engravers, of the die-and punch-making of the goldsmiths (after all, he was a goldsmith himself).<sup>2</sup> What did Gutenberg invent?
					</p>
					<p>
						In order that letters, characters, may be arranged in lines, line upon line, for printing, each letter must be of the same depth or body-size as its neighbours, irrespective of its individual width: the vertical dimension (y in Cartesian co-ordinates) is critical. If, as seems historically probable, Gutenberg's invention was that of the adjustable type-mould, tolerant of characters of differing widths, intolerant of divergence in body-size [1: overleaf], this invention acted as a vertical grid upon the setting, the form, the page.

				[4] Stéphane Mallarmé, 'Un coup de dés', Cosmopolis, May 1897. Consider also the problems necessarily raised by poets in a socio-religious sense, discussed by Stefan Themerson, Cardinal Pölätüo (London: Gaberbocchus Press, 1961); note also the problems of relating the manuscript to typographical constraints, discussed by the same author in a most creative article 'Idéogrammes lyriques' (Typographica, no. 14, 1966, pp. 2-24). -->

						But the length of line, the width of setting, provided another dimension. It seem that this horizontal dimension (x) of the grid was determined by convention, and embodied in the Procrustean bed of the composing stick probably at that time, as more lately in the case of 13-pica fixed newspaper sticks, an unadjustable hod into which the standard bricks of characters could be successionally piled.
					</p>
					<p>
						Of course, the fixing of a horizontal dimension or 'measure' demands conventions of variable spacing between words, or of abbreviation of the words themselves <sup>2</sup>, if all the characters align at left, where the line begins, 'and are to end as leadsoldiers dressed by the right. The multifarious grids used by the scribes were directly translated into the techniques of metal setting. The scribes had long explored the two-dimensional axes, long before Gutenberg, long before Descartes described them as constraints.
					</p>
					<p>
						This account restricts itself to those who used the Latin alphabet, who read from left to right; but only so far as concerns continuous narrative text. Quite early on, even in the days of incunabula, not only letters but other characters, for example numerals, needed setting - and in the attempt of mathematical conventions to show the sequence of a proof, equalities and tabulations were aligned, each below its antecedent step: centring a new implicit axis on the page <sup>3</sup>.
					</p>
					<p>
						So during centuries: for the first ninety years of typographic printing saw the exploration and development of justified and unjustified setting, of italic, of new letters (J and U surviving; some, like the omega, left at last), of punctuation marks. After <time datetime="1530">1530</time>, though, interest shifted toward experiment in letter design and, later, mechanical improvement.
					</p>
					<p> 
						All later work, until the demands of writers such as Blake or Mallarmé disrupted the conventions, considered the typographic grid unalterable <sup>4</sup>. And even with the poets, their understanding of typography was such that they hardly considered the presentation of their personal desires a challenge to the grid.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here's a sadness.Typography, as taught in schools of art, and captioned in the illustrated books, is mostly but a word delimiting a field of art/craft-history; books of types, of typographic ornaments and rules, of title-pages (fewer books of double-page spreads), sit on their shelves or presses. Typography has become the study of placing letters onafield: typography, a more precise form oflettering. And lettering, calligraphy, has died some sweet Roman death or letraset itself below the ground.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is time, after half a millennium,for the re-assessment of typography. In architecture, stones, mud, plants humbled together, were governed; labour was delegated, craftsmen worked their feeling for materials on that material, builders organized, architects, later, chiefed constructions. After the decline of architecture, all major work nowadays is done by those who dreamed of white cathedrals or had an intimate experience or interest in their material, old or new.

					Viewing grids through this lens, I realized that the relationship between grids and typography is not fixed, rather they are closely connected. Type creates expression, the grid brings order, like how language uses grammar as a structural tool but allows unlimited ways to express ideas. <span> It's visual form, typography, relies on grids as a system of structure to communicate with clarity, providing a set of restrictions for creativity to play into. </span>

					With systems and rules, comes power structure. Froshaugh connects the relationship between typography and grid to cartography. In cartography, the grid acts as a way to orient the viewer. The grid provides guidance for the reader and suggests a sense of order. These elements shouldn't be seen as completely neutral, they indirectly express values, politics, cultural norms, and power. Froshaugh shares the example of reading from left-to-right reading, a primary western way to read. Today, this applies to how we design interfaces, documents, and websites. This also applies to the power that our phones, and the many grids within it (most notably, the instagram grid) captures and controls our attention.

					Froshaugh's <cite>Typography is a Grid</cite> addresses a system of organization that, at its time became the dominant system for organizing typography. When it was published in 1960s Britain, It was heavily accepted as the only way type can be laid out and can be clearly identified in the way in which Froshaugh's own text is arranged. At this time, a new generation of modernist designers was emerging and gaining influence in London's design scene, as well as the tremendous growth of London's steel industry. This changing environment also led to a change in how space and subsequently type were perceived. Thus, the grid became more than a tool; it symbolized order and modernity. Printing, was also designed as an arrangement of individual characters fixed within a metal framework, which meant that a grid was both a product of the tool and a result of it. The adoption of printing led to a widespread acceptance of the grid as the way type should be arranged.

					Just as early typographers used grids for printed text, today's designers use them to arrange content on screens. The grid has become a standard, shaping how we interact with information. Continuing to speak to the singular identity of the web today, heavily simplified in its conceptual approach.
				</p>
				<p>
					Grids allow information to become accessible, but they can also reduce creativity and limit the variety of design concepts someone can create. Froshaug's persuasion to rethink typography, even after hundreds of years, highlights this tension. As designers, it is our role to use these systems knowingly, understanding when to follow and break the rules we set for ourselves.
