            <h2>Anthony Froshaugh, 1967</h2>
            <p>'Typography is a grid'. Published 1967, in: The Designer [bibl. 122]. The article was written at the height of the vogue for grid-based graphic design, imported into Britain from (especially) Switzerland. In an earlier contribution to The Designer, Brian Grimbly-a friend and colleague of AF -had discussed grids in a purely pragmatic way, as a tool for designers. ('Designing to a grid', The Designer, no. 162, August 1966, pp. 4-5). AF then wrote this 'call to order', restating central tenets of his approach to typography. Some slight editorial changes have been made in reprinting the article here. Notes to the text and illustrations were originally numbered in one sequence, but have here been renumbered in two sequences. As explained in the editorial note on p. 189 below, the cover image ofthat issue of The Designer constituted one of the illustrations. It has been omitted here: reproduced small it would have little meaning, and similar images can be seen in the reproductions from Typographic norms on pp. 71-4 above. 'Typography is a grid' was reprinted in Design Dialogue, no.1, 1969: a magazine edited by students at Stafford College of Art and Design. A F's work was important for the design course at Stafford, as Peter Burnhill implied in his retrospective: 'Outside the whale', Information Design Journal, vol.8, no. 3, 1996, pp. 195-218. </p> 
            <p> <strong>Grid structures are implicit in the word typography. After half a millennium it is time for an understanding and re-assessment</strong> </p>
